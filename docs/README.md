# cli

[![Go Reference](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/steverusso/cli.svg)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/steverusso/cli)

This is primarily a library to parse command line arguments. Anything it offers in
addition to that (such as optionally reading values from environment variables as well)
should be invisible to the user who wants to simply parse command line arguments.
